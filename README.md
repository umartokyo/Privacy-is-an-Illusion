# Privacy is an Illusion
 My art project for school


## Background
This is the SA for the "Political Art" Unit, with focus on juxtaposition. The project consists of two parts:
- **Sketch** with a person filled with 1's and 0's being watched by camera and things that person is secured. 
- **Website** which will say that *"Security is an illusion"* and give the user the location of the user which the website could access. 

By the initial plan, I needed to host the website to the web, generate the qr-code and add it to my artwork, but I had some issues with hosting, and due to that I'll leave a link to the docker container.

## Access
- Sketch: sketch.txt
- Website: video.mov | [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/umarik/privacyisillusion/general)

## Libraries
If you want to play around with the application, here are the libraries used: 
- flask
- requests
